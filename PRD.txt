# Hybrid Optimistic PBFT Secure Aggregation - PRD

## 1. Product Overview

This project implements and evaluates a hybrid optimistic PBFT secure aggregation method for federated learning systems. It extends the existing FL-multi-aggregator framework to support multiple consensus mechanisms and measure their performance characteristics.

## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Hybrid Strategy Core
- Multi-aggregator simulation with configurable strategies
- Challenge mechanism with PBFT consensus integration
- Configurable challenge frequency for hybrid mode
- Processing time tracking for performance comparison

### 2.2 Strategy Types
- Round Robin (RR): Traditional multi-aggregator with no challenges
- Hybrid: Optimistic approach with 1/4 of rounds challenged
- PBFT: Traditional consensus with all rounds challenged

### 2.3 Research Data Collection
- Processing time metrics for each strategy type
- Comparative analysis across strategies
- Performance overhead measurements
- Visualization generation for thesis validation

## 3. Core Functionality

### 3.1 PBFT Consensus Integration
- Support for multiple validators in the system
- Implementation of prepare and commit phases
- Configurable consensus threshold (default 2/3)
- Validator selection and management

### 3.2 Hybrid Challenge Mechanism
- Configurable challenge frequency (default 1/4)
- Deterministic or random challenge selection
- Challenge period simulation
- Optimistic execution for non-challenged rounds

### 3.3 Performance Measurement
- Processing time tracking per round
- Strategy-specific metrics collection
- Overhead analysis compared to baseline
- Statistical significance testing

### 3.4 Comparative Analysis
- Side-by-side comparison of all three strategies
- Scalability analysis with varying parameters
- Security vs. performance tradeoffs
- Thesis validation metrics
