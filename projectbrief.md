# Project Brief

This project is a research proof-of-concept (PoC) for Blockchain Federated Learning (BFL), demonstrating how blockchain can enhance federated learning (FL) via a challenge mechanism. The MVP simulates multiple aggregators in FL, with a focus on detecting and mitigating malicious behavior through challenge and verification. The system is designed for research, extensibility, and academic publication.

## MVP Scope
- Multi-aggregator simulation with round-robin selection
- Malicious aggregator modeling and detection
- Challenge submission and verification framework
- Research data collection and visualization

## High-Level Goals
- Advance research in secure, robust federated learning
- Provide a reproducible, extensible simulation platform
- Enable comparative analysis of challenge-based FL security
