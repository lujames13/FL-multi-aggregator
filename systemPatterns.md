# System Patterns

## Architecture
- Modular design: simulation core, challenge mechanism, research tools
- Extends Flower's FedAvg for multi-aggregator support
- Round-robin aggregator selection per round
- Configurable malicious behavior and challenge logic

## Design Patterns
- Strategy pattern for aggregation and challenge logic
- Metrics and results logging for research reproducibility
- Scenario-based configuration for flexible experimentation
